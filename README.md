# go-tibia: Tibia tools in Go

Just a toy project to see how far Go's built in crypto primitives can take me.

## gotserv: OTServ in Go

Main binary: `badc0de.net/pkg/gotserv/cmd/gotserv`

So far implemented: partial parsing of login protocol.

## Libraries

There's a spr reader, a dat reader, an otb reader, and built on top of otb reader, an items.otb reader.
